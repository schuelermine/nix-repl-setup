# nixos-repl-setup

This is a small utility that defines a payload, that, when loaded in your nix repl session, will prepopulate useful variables from your NixOS configuration

# Usage

The main function is under `repl-setup` if imported as a flake.

It takes these arguments:

- `source`: A URL or file path to the system configuration
- `isUrl`: Whether `source` is a flake URL  
  If this is unset, most URLs will fail
- `plainImport`: Whether to disregard `flake.nix` and always use import
- `passExtra`: A list of attributes to pass through  
  This uses a special format to navigate attrsets. A string will be interpreted as an attribute, a list of attributes as an attribute path, and a list of a string and another list as a renamed attribute path.  
  If youâ€™re using a flake this is with respect to the flake itself. If not, with respect to the configuration (called `system`).  
  By default, flakes passthrough `inputs.nixpkgs`, and `inputs.nixpkgs.lib`.
  By default, non-flakes passthrough `pkgs.lib`.
  (`pkgs` is always passed)

Flake-only arguments:

- `hostname`: What hostname the desired configuration is under. Otherwise it will select the first, alphabetically.

# Example

Save this as an easily accesible file (e.g. `~/repl.nix`):

```nix
let nixos-repl-setup = builtins.getFlake "github:schuelermine/nixos-repl-setup/ce5bc68652d489ebeccb6cd867b4a2c7ce669da3";
in nixos-repl-setup.repl-setup {
    hostname = "GigueMowHeadGrape";
    source = "git+file:///etc/nixos/";
    isUrl = true;
    passExtra = [ [ "l" [ "inputs" "nixpkgs" "lib" ] ] [ "inputs" "MyFlake" "fubar" "egg" ] ];
}
```
